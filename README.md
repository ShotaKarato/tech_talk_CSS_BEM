# The Thorough Guide of CSS Naming Convention ‘BEM’

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.\
\
This is the repository for all the files I prepared for the demo of **The Thorough Guide of CSS Naming Convention ‘BEM’**.\
During the demo, I created a mock version of this beautiful website by Soapply (https://soapplybox.com/).
